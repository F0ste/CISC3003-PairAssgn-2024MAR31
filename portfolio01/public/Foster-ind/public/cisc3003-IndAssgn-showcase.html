        <h2>Learning Log</h2>
        <p>I have been keeping track of my learning journey and progress through my Learning Log. I am currently studying web programming, Java, and software management. It has been a challenging yet rewarding experience so far, and I am proud of the progress I have made. Through my learning log, I have been able to reflect on my strengths and weaknesses, and this has helped me to improve and grow as a student. I look forward to continuing my learning journey and exploring new topics and challenges.</p>
