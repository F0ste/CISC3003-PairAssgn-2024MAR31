        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>I'm currently pursuing my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at the University of Macau, where I'm in my third year of studies. Before enrolling at the University of Macau, I studied at Yuet Wah College. I've always been passionate about technology and computer science, and I'm thrilled to be learning about these subjects in-depth at the university level. Through my coursework and research projects, I've gained a deeper understanding of the field and the impact that technology can have on society. I'm eager to continue my education and contribute to the growing field of computer science in meaningful ways.</p>

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <p>In 2019, I worked as a census worker for the Statistics and Census Service. As a census worker, my main responsibility was to collect population data through telephone surveys and fill out forms based on the results of these surveys. This experience helped me to develop my communication skills and taught me how to work effectively under pressure. I also gained a deeper appreciation for the importance of accurate data collection and analysis in informing policy decisions and improving the lives of individuals and communities. Overall, my time as a census worker was a valuable learning experience and helped me to develop important skills that I can apply in future positions.</p>

        <h2>Services</h2>
        <p>I offer a unique service of building Personal Computers for free. I enjoy discussing and advising people on the best PC components that would suit their needs. After we finalize the PC list, I would accompany them to I-Square to purchase the parts. I then go to their home and assemble their PC for them. After the assembly is complete, I would also assist them in installing the Windows operating system and Microsoft Office. It's my way of giving back to the community and helping others in need.</p>
